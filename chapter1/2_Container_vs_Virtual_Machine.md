# Container vs Virtual Machines

## Virtual Machine
- Virtualize physical hardware
- Each VM has own Guest OS
- Uses Hypervisor (small layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other)

## Container
- Virtualize OS
- Simply leverage the features and resources of the host OS.
- Container Engine and its minimal guest OS
